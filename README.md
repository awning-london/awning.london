This project is a modern, responsive website built with Next.js, designed for an awning company based in London. The site provides a platform to showcase various awning products and services, making it easy for clients to explore options for enhancing their outdoor spaces.

## Key Features:

The website is fully optimized for SEO, fast-loading, and responsive across devices. Hosted under a GitHub organization, it uses CDN configurations for enhanced performance and aims to create an engaging, user-friendly experience for visitors.

This project is part of an initiative to establish a strong online presence for the company, reaching a broader audience while highlighting the company’s expertise in the awning industry.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
